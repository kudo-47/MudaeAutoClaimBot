## üöÄ Features
- ‚úÖ Auto-claim characters from your watchlist  
- ‚úÖ Claim characters based on minimum kakera value  
- ‚úÖ Supports `$rt` flow (auto uses `$rt` when claim is on cooldown)  
- ‚úÖ Auto-reacts to kakera buttons (with optional confirmation)  
- ‚úÖ Parses `$tu` for timers (claim, rolls, kakera cooldown, `$rt`, daily, vote)  
- ‚úÖ Retries failed clicks and avoids duplicate claims  
- ‚úÖ Per-channel timers, locks, and claim events for safe concurrency

### üìÇ Example `.env` file

```env
# Discord token 
DISCORD_TOKEN= "your_discord_token_here"

# Base timer delay in seconds
TIMER=10

# Channels & owner setup
CHARACTER_CHANNEL_ID=123456789012345678
COMMANDS_CHANNEL_ID=123456789012345678
OWNER_ID=123456789012345678

# Allowed rolling channels
ALLOWED_CHANNELS=1163895503143043135,1310112309850406946

# Claiming settings
MIN_KAKERA=200
KAKERA_LIST=["kakera","kakeraT","kakeraG","kakeraY","kakeraO","kakeraR","kakeraW","kakeraL"]

# Retry/timeout settings
CLICK_RETRIES=3
CLICK_RETRY_DELAY=0.8
ROLL_WAIT_EVENT_TIMEOUT=6.0

# Rolling commands (randomized use)
ROLLING_COMMANDS=$wa,$ha,$ma
DELAY_BETWEEN_ROLLS= 3 
```

3. Run the Bot
```bash
python main.py
```


You should see output like:
```

‚úÖ Logged in as USERNAME!
üìú Loaded 123 characters
üåç Fetching timers in #games
üéØ Watching for characters: ['rem', 'megumin', 'asuna']
üí† Watching for kakera: ['kakeray','kakeral',...]
```

## üîë Owner Commands

Owner commands must be typed in `COMMANDS_CHANNEL_ID` by `OWNER_ID`.

| Command            | Description                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `$reloadchars`     | Reload list from `CHARACTER_CHANNEL_ID`.     |
| `$addchars rem, asuna` | Add characters to list.                 |
| `$removechars rem, asuna` | Remove characters from list.         |
| `$listchars`       | Display current list of characters.          |
| `$clearallchars`   | Wipe all characters after confirmation.      |

üìã Flow Overview

Startup ‚Üí Fetch $tu timers from each allowed channel.

Auto-roll ‚Üí When claim is available (or $rt usable), rolls up to remaining rolls.

Auto-claim ‚Üí On new rolls, if character is in list or kakera ‚â• MIN_KAKERA, tries to claim.

If claim unavailable but $rt is, bot sends $rt, refreshes timers, then claims.

Confirms success via embed footer (Belongs to ...).

Kakera reaction ‚Üí If kakera reaction is available, clicks reaction buttons with human-like delay.

üõ†Ô∏è Notes & Tips

Click retries: By default, bot retries failed click actions up to 3 times (CLICK_RETRIES).

Random delays: Introduces random ¬±1s offsets before clicks to mimic human behavior.

Timeouts: $tu fetch, claim events, and kakera confirmations have explicit timeout handling.

Character names are matched case-insensitive.
```
üß© Example Console Logs
üì° Fetching timers in #games-2 (per-channel only)
üé≤ Rolled character in #games-2: Kagari Hosho (kakera 42)
‚è≥ Waiting 9.80s before attempting claim for Kagari Hosho in #games-2...
üõë Claim/rt detected during rolls ‚Äî stopping further rolls.
‚û° Moving to next channel after claim in #games-2.
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q:** The bot keeps timing out when fetching `$tu`.  
**A:** Increase timeout in `ROLL_WAIT_EVENT_TIMEOUT`, or reduce frequency of checks.  

**Q:** It didn‚Äôt claim even though character is in my list.  
**A:** Check spacing ‚Äî names must exactly match Mudae‚Äôs output (case ignored).  

**Q:** Can it double-claim?  
**A:** No ‚Äî locks prevent multiple claim attempts.
