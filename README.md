# 🎲 Mudae Auto-Claimer Bot

A Discord selfbot-style client that helps with auto-rolling, claiming characters, and kakera reactions for the Mudae bot.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
This script automates interaction with Mudae. Using automation can violate server rules or Discord’s ToS.  
Use only in private servers or with permission. You are solely responsible for how you use this.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Auto-claim characters from your watchlist  
- ✅ Claim characters based on minimum kakera value  
- ✅ Supports `$rt` flow (auto uses `$rt` when claim is on cooldown)  
- ✅ Auto-reacts to kakera buttons (with optional confirmation)  
- ✅ Parses `$tu` for timers (claim, rolls, kakera cooldown, `$rt`, daily, vote)  
- ✅ Retries failed clicks and avoids duplicate claims  
- ✅ Per-channel timers, locks, and claim events for safe concurrency

## ⚙️ Setup

### Requirements
- Python **3.13+**
- [`discord.py-self`](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py-self/)  
- `python-dotenv`  
- `audioop-lts`  

Install them with:

```bash
pip install -U discord.py-self python-dotenv audioop-lts
```


2. Configuration

**Make a new server and create two channels. one is for storing the character names(CHARACTER_CHANNEL_ID) and another is for commands channel(COMMANDS_CHANNEL_ID)**

Character List

The bot loads claim targets from messages inside the CHARACTER_CHANNEL_ID.

Each line in that channel = one character’s name.

Example:

rem
megumin
asuna

3. Run the Bot
```bash
python main.py
```


You should see output like:
```

✅ Logged in as USERNAME!
📜 Loaded 123 characters
🌍 Fetching timers in #games
🎯 Watching for characters: ['rem', 'megumin', 'asuna']
💠 Watching for kakera: ['kakeray','kakeral',...]
```

## 🔑 Owner Commands

Owner commands must be typed in `COMMANDS_CHANNEL_ID` by `OWNER_ID`.

| `$addchars rem, asuna` | Add characters to list.                 |
| `$removechars rem, asuna` | Remove characters from list.         |
| `$listchars`       | Display current list of characters.          |
| `$clearallchars`   | Wipe all characters after confirmation.      |

📋 Flow Overview

Startup → Fetch $tu timers from each allowed channel.

Auto-roll → When claim is available (or $rt usable), rolls up to remaining rolls.

Auto-claim → On new rolls, if character is in list or kakera ≥ MIN_KAKERA, tries to claim.

If claim unavailable but $rt is, bot sends $rt, refreshes timers, then claims.

Confirms success via embed footer (Belongs to ...).

Kakera reaction → If kakera reaction is available, clicks reaction buttons with human-like delay.

🛠️ Notes & Tips

Click retries: By default, bot retries failed click actions up to 3 times (CLICK_RETRIES).

Random delays: Introduces random ±1s offsets before clicks to mimic human behavior.

Timeouts: $tu fetch, claim events, and kakera confirmations have explicit timeout handling.

Character names are matched case-insensitive.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q:** The bot keeps timing out when fetching `$tu`.  
**A:** Increase timeout in `ROLL_WAIT_EVENT_TIMEOUT`, or reduce frequency of checks.  

**Q:** It didn’t claim even though character is in my list.  
**A:** Check spacing — names must exactly match Mudae’s output (case ignored).  

**Q:** Can it double-claim?  
**A:** No — locks prevent multiple claim attempts.
